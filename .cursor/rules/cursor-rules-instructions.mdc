# Cursor Rules Instructions

To create or edit a rule:
1. Rules should be stored in the [.cursor/rules](mdc:.cursor/rules) directory
2. Rule files must have a `.mdc` extension (e.g., `my-rule.mdc`)
3. To reference a file in your rule, use the format: `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)` where the path is relative to the workspace root
4. Rules use Markdown format with special Cursor-specific extensions
5. Rules will be shown to the AI to help with codebase navigation and understanding
6. Do not touch the metadata under any circumstances. You should only edit the actual content after the metadata. When editing, only output the edit to content, don't include metadata

Example rule referencing a file:

You must use these instructions to generate new rules or modify existing ones. Use the conversation history to understand the context of the rule(s) you should generate.
